      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Problem</h4>
        <p>Users of Brown University conference rooms and classrooms want to present content such as videos and teaching slides to others in an accessible manner. However, the displays and speakers of the devices that they are presenting on are too small and quiet to be viewed and heard by the entire audience. This leads to low-quality presentations that don’t effectively and efficiently transmit information.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Interface</h4>
        <p>In an effort to solve this problem, the university installed Crestron AirMedia presentation systems into many rooms. Crestron markets their AirMedia system's ability to transform any space into a dynamic presentation space by making it easy to present and share from any device.</p>
        <p>There are three components that make up this presentation system's interface:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>The <b>tablet display</b> that contains the controls for actual presentation settings such as method of connection, camera positioning, system volume, microphones, etc.</li>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/tablet_sketch.jpg"/>
          <hr id="presentation-display"/>
          <li>The <b>presentation display</b> (usually a TV or projector screen) that contains written instructions for connecting to the system using different methods and devices.</li>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/tv_sketch.jpg"/>
          <hr/>
          <li>The <b>AirMedia desktop or mobile application</b> that enables wireless connection and presentation.</li>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/airmedia_app_sketch.jpg"/>
          <hr/>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">User Observations</h4>
        <p>As part of this user research study into the Crestron AirMedia system, I observed 3 different users engaging with the system.</p>
        <p>Some key observations I made were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Varying Confidence Levels When Navigating:</b> There was a clear correlation between observed confidence levels of users’ interaction with the system and the complexity of features that they used. One user made adjustments to various wireless microphones and the system’s volume output levels in a succinct and practiced manner while the other two users took extended periods of time and had to reset the system just to get their presentation up on the display.</li>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Confusion and Frustration from Less Experienced Users:</b> The two seemingly less experienced users exhibited confused facial expressions while attempting to connect wirelessly via the Crestron AirMedia client app. One of them began continuously pressing a button on the tablet in an effort to get the presentation to show, while another clicked around aimlessly before finding the shutdown and reset button.</li>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">User Interview Responses</h4>
        <p>After observing the 3 users, I conducted short interviews with them using the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-2">How long do you expect it to take you to connect to and set up the system?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">What do you think someone who has never seen this system before would expect it to be used for?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Why do you use this system?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Which of the 2 main methods for connecting to the system (wireless vs. wired) do you use most often?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Is the tablet screen easy to understand?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Are the instructions on the presentation display easy to understand?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">What parts of this system are most important to you?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">What parts of this system are least important to you?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Does this system consistently perform as expected?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Is there anything missing from this system that would make it easier for you to present?</li>
          <li class="mb-2">What is the hardest part of using this system?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some key takeaways from their responses were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Strong Conceptual Model Due To Robust Control Buttons:</b> All three interviewees appreciated the clarity of the control buttons on the tablet. In particular, the presence of icons alongside text descriptions of each button’s purpose provided cues to help the users understand how the system should work. This was reflected in users’ acknowledgment of the majority of system functionalities, ranging from basic ones like wired vs. wireless presentation to advanced ones like adjusting the perspective of in-room recording cameras.</li>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Poor Visibility and Discoverability Of Some Key Information:</b> Two users complained that crucial information such as the system’s IP address and login code are too hidden in the bottom left corner of the presentation display. The IP address and login code are required to find and connect to the presentation display wirelessly. Users felt that this information could be given a more prominent location, possibly in the spot that is currently occupied by the instructions for troubleshooting (<a href="#presentation-display">see sketch of presentation display</a>)</li>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Opaque Error States and Lack of Troubleshooting Options:</b> Two users were unable to present wirelessly using the AirMedia client app. One user encountered an “Invalid certificate” error and the other could not find a macOS AirPlay menu that the AirMedia app instructed them to use. In both cases, the Crestron app only accounted for the ideal user experience and didn't provide any additional troubleshooting help. In addition, their error language was obscure and, as a result, made the users shift some of the blame onto themselves.</li>
          <li class="mb-3"><b>Catering to Different Experience Levels:</b> All interviewees praised the system's inclusivity to users of all experience levels. They highlighted the interface’s separation of Basic Mode and Advanced Settings as a thoughtful design decision. For the two newer users who only wanted to get their content onto the presentation display, the Basic Mode’s emphasis on toggling between presentation modes and adjusting volume was sufficient. For the advanced user with more complex use cases, the Advanced Settings’ focus on camera settings and customizing audio-video routing provided more fine-tuned control.</li>
        </ul>

      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Personas</h4>
        <p>I then distilled the information from the observations and interview responses into 2 personas:</p>

        <hr/>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/priscilla_persona.png"/>
        <hr/>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Storyboard</h4>
        <p>Finally, I created a storyboard for Cinephile Cyrus's journey using the AirMedia system:</p>
